## Problem Statement: Develop an NLP model that categorizes complaint based on victim, type of fraud and other relevant parameters used for text classification and preparing the final model.

---

### Key Challenges

1. **Manual Classification**: Sorting through thousands of complaints by hand is slow and inefficient.
2. **Lack of Prioritization**: Itâ€™s difficult to identify and respond to high-severity cases quickly.

---

## Our Solution

Our solution is an NLP-based classification model designed to automatically analyze and categorize fraud complaints. By leveraging Natural Language Processing, the model quickly identifies key elements within each complaint, such as:

- **Fraud Type**: Categorizes cases into phishing, identity theft, cyberstalking, and more.
- **Victim Type**: Distinguishes between individual and organizational victims.
- **Severity and Urgency**: Flags high-severity cases for quick response.

### Key Features

- **Automated Categorization**: Reduces manual workload by instantly classifying incoming complaints.
- **Resource Prioritization**: Helps teams focus on critical cases, ensuring efficient use of resources.

### Benefits

- **Increased Efficiency**: Faster classification means quicker response times.
- **Enhanced Decision-Making**: Prioritized cases enable focused and effective resource allocation.
- **Trend Detection**: Analyzing patterns in fraud complaints helps in anticipating and countering potential spikes in specific fraud types.
